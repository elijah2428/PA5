# 📊EXPERIMENT 5 - INTRODUCTION TO MATLAB PROGRAMMING

## 📝Overview
#### This repository contains MATLAB code for Experiment 5: Introduction to MATLAB Programming. This experiment introduces fundamental MATLAB programming techniques, with a focus on matrix operations and solving linear equations. It emphasizes understanding MATLAB’s syntax and the efficient application of built-in functions for engineering calculations.
## Learning Objectives 
#### This experiment aims to:
#### •	Identify and utilize MATLAB codes and built-in functions.
#### •	Apply these functions in MATLAB to solve problems related to matrix manipulation and linear equations.

### ⚙️Problem 1: Matrix Transpose Operations
#### •	Aside from the transpose command, there are two other operations that appears to do thesame. These are the operators ‘ (apostrophe after the variable) and .’ (a dot and apostrophe after thevariable). Determine the differences between these three operations by showing your program to the class

### 🔢Problem 2: Solving Linear Equations
#### Solve a system of five linear equations with five unknowns using two different methods:
#### •	Inverse Method: Using the matrix inverse to solve for the unknowns.
#### •	Cramer's Rule: Applying determinants to solve the system.
